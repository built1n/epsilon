Building==========================================================================
 You will need these packages to build OpenRPG: GNU G++, and GNU Make. To build, 
 simply run 'make'. It will produce an executable in the current directory called
 'mud'.
Running===========================================================================
 Simply run 'mud' to load the default game file (in the working directory), and 
 play it. Other games, ending with .world, are also availible.
Making your own world=============================================================
 All game files start with the text 'World' followed by the version number, and end with the text 'EndWorld' The current version number is 1.0. Then, the rest of the 
 world is divided into rooms. The world can have a maximum weight that can be
 carried by the player. A weight of -1 implies no maximum. The maximum weight is 
 specified by 'MaxWeight' followed by the maximum weight in kg. Rooms are defined 
 as follows:

  Room 1 "Room Name" "Room description"
  ...
  EndRoom

 The number following 'Room' is the room number. It is used internally for 
 specifying adjacent rooms. Adjacent rooms are defined as follows:
  
  World 1.0
  MaxWeight 10
  Room 1 "Room 1" "Room 1"
  Adjacent east 2
  EndRoom
  Room 2 "Room 2" "Room 2"
  Adjacent west 1
  EndRoom
  EndWorld

 This will produce a world with 2 rooms, with room 1 being to the west of room 2.
 Specifying that room 2 is east of room 1, does not automatically imply that room 
 1 is west of room 2. You'll need to specify this yourself. Objects are inside
 rooms. They can have descriptions, like rooms, and can be taken, if so specified.
 They are defined as follows:

  World 1.0
  MaxWeight 10
  Room 1 "Object Room" "There is stuff here."
  Object cpu "It's an Intel 386."
  Printable
  Alias chip
  Alias i386
  Alias 386
  Weight .1
  Takeable
  EndObject
  EndRoom
  EndWorld
 
 Objects have several properties:

  Printable/Unprintable  | Printability in object list
  -----------------------+----------------------------
  Weight (in kg.)        | Weight, duh :P
  -----------------------+----------------------------
  Takeable/Untakeable    | Can the player take it?
  -----------------------+----------------------------
  Alias (not implemented)| An alternate name

Reporting bugs====================================================================
 Make sure that you can CONSISTENTLY reproduce the bug, and send a sample game
 file, if applicable. If not, then fix it yourself (see below)!
Code layout=======================================================================
 +===*WARNING*===+
 |  The code is  |
 |  rather hard  |
 |   to read!!   |
 +===============+
 There are two main structures: Room, and Object, defined in room.h, and object.h.
 The world is internally represented as an associative array of int=>Room, called
 rooms. To read a game file from disk, the readMap() (in read.cpp) function is 
 used. This is a rather slow function, and it could use some improvement 
 (error-checking!). From there, the entire game is run in the main() function.
